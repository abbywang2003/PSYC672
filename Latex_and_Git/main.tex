\abstract{Misophonia is a condition characterized by strong emotional and physiological responses to specific trigger sounds. While extensively studied in Western populations, research on misophonia in Chinese populations remains limited, possibly due to the lack of assessment instruments. This study aimed to develop and validate a Mandarin version of the Duke Misophonia Questionnaire (DMQ) for use in China. A sample of 704 Mandarin-speaking participants completed the DMQ alongside other psychometric instruments assessing related constructs, including anxiety, depression, hyperacusis, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Item Response Theory (IRT) analysis confirmed a predominantly comparable structure between the Mandarin and English versions, though some subscales exhibited cross-cultural differences. Reliability analyses indicated strong internal consistency, and validity assessments demonstrated robust convergent and discriminant validity. Notably, affective and cognitive responses to misophonic triggers showed significant correlations with anxiety and depressive symptoms, highlighting potential shared mechanisms. These findings support the Mandarin DMQ as a reliable and valid tool for assessing misophonia in Chinese populations and provide insights into cultural influences on misophonia symptomatology. Future research should further explore the role of cultural norms in shaping symptom expression and coping strategies.}
